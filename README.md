# Rust library: qr2term
A stupidly simple QR code renderer, that prints text as QR code to the terminal,
and nothing else.

[`example.rs`](./examples/example.rs):
```rust
fn main() {
    qr2term::print_qr("https://rust-lang.org/");
}
```

This library is based on [`qair`](https://code.willemp.be/willem/qair),
which didn't provide the renderer as a library on it's own.
Credits for the actual renderer go to it's developer.
